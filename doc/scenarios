scenario #1

A user adds several just purchased products to its account by reading their barcode. Once the barcode is read, then,
if product does not exist on the DB, the user can add it along with a picture, purchased price, descriptions and
geographical reference where it was acquired (latitude and longitude of the supermarket).

if product does exist, then, the user just need to add the price it was acquired.

After all the products where added, then the user may decided to get the amount of money spent in a specific range of time.
  e.g. Get me the amount of money spend between 11/29/2016 and  12/29/2016

scenario #2

A user wants to know where to get the best price of a product according to its location.
The product can be obtained either by its barcode id or by its description.
In case the user types an incomplete description of the product, then several other products may appear for the user
to select one of them.

scenario #3

A user wants to know what are their usually bought products. After knowing a ranking about its most bought products,
then he may want to be suggested about where that pack (group of most usually bought products) can be conveniently
acquired according to its location.
